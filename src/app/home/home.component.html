  Self-learned full-stack developer. Have an open-source community nixgram on
  GitHub to help junior geeks. Work with versatile technology because that's my
  dream. Try to build up a habit to know what's going on under the hood until
  things do not seem like magic. <br /><br />
  Ask me about .NET, Angular, React & Ionic. Love
